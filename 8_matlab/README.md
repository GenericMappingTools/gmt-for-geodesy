**Resources**

* The [GMT/MEX documentation](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmtmex/wiki)
* The [GMT/MEX publication](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheGenericMappingTools)
* The [GMT/MEX repository](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmtmex)

**Files**

The Live Script gmtmex_demo.mlx in this directory reproduces the demonstration of GMT/MEX 
and duplicates some of the examples in the GMT/MEX publication.  Various data sets are
provided that are used by the demo.

**Common Problems**:

* While the GMT Windows installer comes with GMT/MEX (assuming you have MATLAB installed), the macOS and Linux builds are more complicated at this point; see links above.
* GMT/MEX was designed before GMT Modern mode and works best for classic GMT
* GMT/MEX can also be compiled to work with the Open Source clone Octave
* There have been some regression problems in GMT/MEX since 6.2 that we will need to fix; thus I am avoiding running
  examples that experiences those problems.
