Topic: Geodesy

- Tuesday June 27 9:00 PM - 10:30 PM EST - [Time Zone converter](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=GMT+for+Geodesy+Office+Hours+Part+3+-+Geodesy&iso=20230628T21&p1=3918&ah=1&am=30)

**Where**:
On-line via zoom

**Planning**:
Participants must **have their own computers** (macOS, Windows, or Linux) with the
required **software already installed** (see [Installing](#installing) below).

This course will cover the use of Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) in geodesy
using UNIX shell scripting. Lectures and exercises will be given to teach the
basic conventions of using GMT, such as plotting grids, images, and vector data
(points, lines, polygons, GPS velocities) as well as making animations. Instructors will help participants with processing and mapping of various data sets relevant to geodesy during the office hours.

## Installing

Participants will need to install some software for the workshop.
Please follow [these instructions](INSTALL.md) **before the workshop**.

## Need help?

If you have any trouble installing or questions about the course/homework,
there are a few ways to ask for help:

* Open an *Issue* on this repository by
  [clicking here](https://github.com/GenericMappingTools/gmt-for-geodesy/issues/new/choose).
  You'll need a GitHub account to do this.
* Post to the [GMT Community Forum](https://forum.generic-mapping-tools.org/)

## Video, Slides and Notes

The lectures are available on [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmtQ1yTWqC4&list=PL3GHXjKa-p6XP5sL0XPdRJhklVNX-N5ht). The material for each section is available in the folders in this repository.

## Schedule

Please make sure you know the local time for the sessions!  Use the time zone converter provided for each office hour and compare UTC to your time zone.
Participants will receive the zoom invitation at least 24 hours before the start of each session. The lectures are available on YouTube one week in advance of the course.
